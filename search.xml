Jeff Hawkins and his team discovered that the brain uses maplike structures to build a model of the world - not just one model, but hundreds of thousands of models of everything we know. This discovery allows Hawkins to answer important questions about how we perceive the world, why we have a sense of self, and the origin of high-level thought. “A Thousand Brains” heralds a revolution in the understanding of intelligence. It is a big-think book, in every sense of the word.</p><p>About the panelists</p><p>Jeff Hawkins is a well-known scientist and entrepreneur, considered one of the most successful and highly regarded computer architects in Silicon Valley. He is widely known for founding Palm Computing and Handspring Inc., and for being the architect of many successful handheld computers. Despite his successes as a technology entrepreneur, Hawkins’ primary passion and occupation has been neuroscience. From 2002 to 2005, Hawkins directed the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, now located at U.C. Berkeley. He is currently co-founder and chief scientist at Numenta, a research company focused on neocortical theory.</p><p>Hawkins also wrote On Intelligence in 2004, with Sandra Blakeslee. He has given over one hundred invited talks at research universities, scientific institutions, and corporate research laboratories. He has been recognized with numerous personal and industry awards and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2003.</p><p>Subutai Ahmad is the VP of Research and Engineering at Numenta, bringing with him experience across real time systems, computer vision and learning. He previously served as VP Engineering at YesVideo, Inc. where he helped grow the company from a three-person start-up to a leader in automated digital media authoring. In 1997, Subutai co-founded ePlanet Interactive, a spin-off from Interval Research. ePlanet developed the IntelPlay Me2Cam, the first computer vision product developed for consumers. He has served as a key researcher at Interval Research.</p><p>Subutai holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Cornell University, and a Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While pursuing his Ph.D, Subutai completed a thesis on computational neuroscience models of visual attention.</p><p>Moderated by Peter Norvig.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Get the book here: <a href="https://goo.gle/3vMY4Ok">https://goo.gle/3vMY4Ok</a>.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS5zcTGiAH4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS5zcTGiAH4</a> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>]]></content>
